# Trip Planner
Trip Planner is an application that allows any number of people to collaboratively and efficiently plan a trip together. Its creation was inspired by the difficulties often faced while planning group tripsâ€”many moving parts require many applications and tools, resulting in fragmented workflows and miscommunication. Trip Planner provides an abundance of features to avoid such issues and provide anything planners may need.

A user begins by creating a trip and inviting their friends. All collaborators can access and edit the itinerary in real time; they may suggest activities, mark dates, and pin locations on a map. Should any disagreements arise, a built-in voting system may be used to simplify decisions while minimizing back-and-forth. Users can add shared checklists to the trip and delegate list items to themselves or other users; items delegated to the current user appear in their personal to-do list. A budget tracker will also be made available to set a trip budget and track shared expenses.

Trip Planner is intended for anyone planning a trip. Its features were created with facilitating collaboration in mind, but a solo traveler will also find the application useful in keeping their planning centralized and well-organized.

This application was built as a semester-long group project for the course *COMPSCI 520 Software Engineering* at UMass Amherst.
